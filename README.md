This is a project for a pcb which is meant to work as a contact smartcard.

For prototyping, I used jlcpcb.com. You need to use a PCB Thickness of 0.8 to make sure your smartcard will fit nicely.

To generate the Gerber files for jlcpcb, follow the following instructions: https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/43-how-to-export-eagle-pcb-to-gerber-files
